# DAYZ DEBUG MODE!
DayZ Debug Mode is a simple drag and drop system for setting up DayZ Servers on your Local Machine.

This simple server setup is based on the Documentation provided by boheima on how to setup a server locally. 

## So what is DEBUG MODE exactly?
Debug mode is a set of .bat files and a folder structures to replicates the way your server will run nativiely but on your local machine.  

There are no built in admin tools or extra feature. It is strcitly vanillia dayz until you add your mods to the !Server_Name.bat

## Why use DEBUG MODE?
If you are working on multiple mods, or you own several servers it can be difficult to manage and maintain your files if you dont have a good base for orginization. Esspecially if you are new to either of these things. This Debug mode focuses on that and creates a consolidated location server to help owners debug logs, and test mod features.

## Whats included?
A set of icons, and the current mission files for a Experimental server and a Vanilla ones as well. 

NOTE: Current Mission Files can be updated by downloading DayZ Server and DayZ Experimental Server via Steam. But I will keep this repos files up to date with the latest version for all default examples. 

### DEBUG Icons  
A group of optional icons you can use to make the links to your .bat files look a little nicer

### expmissions
This is a folder that will contain all the server files for Experimental Servers. It hosts folders with all of your differnt servers missions,configs, and profiles. 

### mpmissions
This is a folder that will contain all the server files for Vanilla Servers. It hosts folders with all of your differnt servers missions,configs, and profiles. 

## How to install
Download or clone this repository to your DayZ Root Folder. Commonly located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZ

After that you will can edit the server configs in each example to fit your needs. Duplicate each example to make more servers.

On a personal note I usuall add the shortcuts to the each server.bat to my desktop then use the my icons to make them look nice. You can create your own if you like or use the ones I have made.
